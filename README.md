EulerUtils
==========

A set of utility functions I've found useful for doing Project Euler problems.

My goal here is to provide some common utilities that I've consistently found useful while doing Project Euler. These are things which I've implemented once and re-use multiple times while doing those problems. I uploaded them to this git repo to make it convenient for me to use them regardless of what system I'm using. If other people want to use them, too, they are welcome.

That being said, the joy of Project Euler comes from solving the problems yourself. Some of this code makes problems trivial, and in that case you might want to ignore this resource and just implement the solution yourself. I'm specifically *not* uploading my solutions here--just the utility functions I've used commonly in the solutions. I'm also not doing more than is necessary to make this code clear and well-written. So if you want to use this code, do prudently and at your own risk.

That being said, good luck and have fun!
